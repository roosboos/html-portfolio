<h1>The Best Movies According to John</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr \>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This film has me thinking about the nature of our reality to this day.</p>
<h3>Blade Runner 2049</h3>
<p>Still the best visuals in a movie I have ever seen. Wish I could watch in IMAX one last time.</p>
<h3>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</h3>
<p>Everything from the art style to the comedy is top notch. Could watch this movie 100 more times.</p>
